How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)

Graceful degradation and service workers both help maintain a website's functionality when conditions aren't ideal. Graceful degradation ensures that even if some modern features don't work due to older technology, the core functions of the website are still available. Service workers help by enabling websites to operate offline or with slow internet by handling network requests and storing important files in a cache.
